[Pattern Synonyms][pattern-synonyms] are one of the awesome new features in GHC 7.8 - they allow you give a name to a pattern and reuse them so you don't need to write the same boilerplate in multiple places. Pattern Synonyms help in a lot of situations, but are especially useful when we try to 
use recursion schemes to abstract away how we recurse over data strutures. We'll be focusing on this today.

First off, let's define the usual preamble we need for the functions we'll write later on:

A Brief Introduction to Functor Fixpoints and Recursion Schemes
---

<small>*You can <a href="#sect2">skip this section</a> if you understand functor fixpoints.*</small>

We'll look at how to write some recursive functions over a simple AST - how annoying it is to rewrite the structure of the recursion, how functor fixpoints can help us to remove this boilerplate but introduce their own and finally how Pattern Synonyms can reduce this.

The normal way you'd write a an abstract syntax tree for expressions in Haskell would be something like this:

> data Expression
>   = Number Int
>   | Variable String
>   | AddE Expression Expression
>   | SubE Expression Expression
>   deriving Show

We can't evaluate these expressions without a mapping from `Variable -> Int`, but we can write a function to simplify these expressions:

> simplifyE :: Expression -> Expression
> simplifyE (Number x)                   = Number x
> simplifyE (Variable n)                 = Variable n 
> simplifyE (AddE (Number 0) b)          = simplifyE b
> simplifyE (AddE a (Number 0))          = simplifyE a
> simplifyE (AddE (Number x) (Number y)) = Number (x + y)
> simplifyE (AddE a b)                   = AddE (simplifyE a) (simplifyE b)
> -- ... similar for SubE ...

However, we have to explicitly write out the structure of the recursion - we must specify that `Number` and `Variable` remain the same and that the subexpressions of `AddE` and `SubE` should also be passed through the same `simplify` function. If we were to write another recursive function over `Expression` we'd have to rewrite all this recursion structure!

We can use Functor Fixpoints to help us here. Rather than writing the the simplistic AST before, we can write the expression AST like so:

> data Expr' a
> 	= Num' Int
> 	| Var' String
> 	| Add' a a
> 	| Sub' a a
> 	| Mul' a a
> 	deriving (Show, Functor)

Here we have *paramterised* the data type in terms of it's subexpressions so we now have a type parameter for all recursive occurences of `Expression`.

* `Expr' a` represents expressions of depth one.
* `Expr' (Expr' a)` represents expressions of depth two.
* `Expr' (Expr' (Expr' a))` represents expressions of depth three.

But how do we represent expressions of arbitrary depths? We can use the `Fix` datatype:

> newtype Fix f = In { out :: f (Fix f) }

This looks like the y-combinator - and indeed it is, but for types! We can use a type synonym to define `Expr`, expressions of arbitrary depth:

> type Expr = Fix Expr'

If we expand out this out step by step we get: `Fix Expr'` -> `Expr' (Fix Expr')` -> `Expr' (Expr' (Fix Expr'))` etc. To make expressions we have to wrap each type of `Expr` in `In` - `Add' (Num' 1) (Var' "b")` becomes `In $ Add' (In $ Num' 1) (In $ Var "b")`

We also need to define an instances for `Fix` for `Show` (requires `UndecidableInstances`):

> instance Show (f (Fix f)) => Show (Fix f) where
>     show (In f) = "(" ++ show f ++ ")"

We can now use the fact that `Expr` is a functor to write recursion schemes like `bottomUp` that describe how we recurse over it:

> bottomUp :: (Fix f -> Fix f) -> Fix f -> Fix f
> bottomUp f = f . In . fmap (bottomUp f) . out

<a href="#" name="sect2">Using Pattern Synonyms to Simplify Fixed Expressions</a>
---

We can now write simplify, this time using the fixed point version so we don't have to explicitly write out the recursion scheme:

> simplify :: Expr -> Expr
> simplify (In (Add' (In (Num' 0)) b)) = b
> simplify (In (Mul' (In (Num' 0)) b)) = In (Num' 0)
> simplify (In (Add' (In (Num' a)) (In (Num' b)))) = In (Num' $ a + b)

`simplify` is just one step of the recursion - to apply it over the whole tree we must use `bottomUp simplify`.

But we've now we have all this `In` noise in our pattern matches and on the right hand sides of our function definition. We can use pattern synonyms to get rid of this - let's define a pattern synonym for each variant of our `Expr'` type.

> pattern Num a = In (Num' a)
> pattern Var a = In (Var' a)
> pattern Add a b = In (Add' a b)
> pattern Sub a b = In (Sub' a b)
> pattern Mul a b = In (Mul' a b)

`pattern PName a <- [pattern]` is called a [uni-directional synonym][uni-dir-synonym] and only allows us to use it for matching. We have used the `pattern PName a = [pattern]` syntax ([simply-bidirectional synonym][simply-bi-dir-synonym]) which allows us to use it in the reverse - we can now write `Num 3` as an expression and this will expand out to `In (Num 3)`. `simplify` now looks like:

> simplify' :: Expr -> Expr
> simplify' (Add (Num 0) b)       = b
> simplify' (Mul (Num 0) b)       = Num 0
> simplify' (Add (Num a) (Num b)) = Num $ a + b

Much nicer! In fact, it looks very similar to the non-fixed `Expression` version. We can go even further and define patterns for `Zero` and `One` so we don't have to repeat `Num 0` and `Num 1`:

> pattern Zero = Num 0
> pattern One = Num 1
>  
> simplify'' :: Expr -> Expr
> simplify'' (Add Zero b) = b
> simplify'' (Mul Zero b) = Zero
> simplify'' (Mul a One)  = a

This is actually easier to read than the original version!

Datatypes a la Carte/Explicit Synonym Syntax
---

Wouter Swierstra's *[Data types a la carte][data-types-carte]* is a classic paper where he describes "a technique for assembling both data types and functions from isolated individual components" and so solving Wadler's [Expression Problem][expression-problem]. This section assumes that you've read the paper/understand the ideas behind it.

Just as we have described in previous section, *Data types a la carte* uses fixed points of types. However, we can't just use our previous solution directly - in section 4 of the paper, "Automating injections", Swierstra uses smart constructors to avoid having to write `In` and `Inl`/`InR` everywhere. We can leverage Pattern Synonyms to use the exact same name for pattern matching and smart constructors. For example, the smart constructor for `Val`:

\ val :: (Val :<: f) => Expr f -> Expr f
\ val x = inject (Val x)

We can use the [explicitly-bidirectional synonym][explicitly-bi-dir-synonym] syntax to remove the need for this strange looking `val` function - we need our pattern matches to be the same but want to produce something different when we called the synonym in expressions.

\ pattern Add' x y <- Add x y
\   Add' x y = inject (Add x y)

Now we can write code like:

\ instance Incr Val where
\   incr (Val i) = Val $ i + 1

Instead of having to use a different name for the smart constructor:

\ instance Incr Val where
\   incr (Val i) = val $ i + 1

Problems
---

We have to write out a new pattern for each variant we have in our fixed datatype. This could be avoided if we used Template Haskell to generate the patterns for us automatically; however Template Haskell does not currently support Pattern Synonyms. If you want to it too, [place a comment on this ticket][template-haskell-ticket] saying you are interested and it'll hopefully make it's way into GHC.
